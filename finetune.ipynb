    "INPUT:\\nComment for April:\\nOverlook Park is close for construction. We expect to see lower visitation stats in the park until the construction in completed. The parking lot is closed, so no buses will park there.  Our car counter is in front of the Welcome Center lot during the construction, which has less than half the number of spaces available, so we expect to see fewer cars on the car counter unit until that changes.   There are three other regular parking lots that are in use that are not monitored by the car counter, and one additional lot that visitors can use on weekends. We have started surveying these parking lots with a calendar created by Pam Zeisler to determine appropriate statistics.\\n\\n### OUTPUT:\\n\n",
