This situation likely caused visitation to these two visitor centers to be lower than they would have been if the buildings were open.

There will no longer be vehicle traffic data collected for the winter.  Vehicle class count was estimated due to equipment failure. The vehicle classifier malfunctioned and was only collecting vehicle count data and did not collect vehicle classification data in October.  During the summer of 2019 we collected classifier data as a pilot project to determine if the park should change its visitor counting methods in the Exit Glacier area.  The 2022 Exit Glacier visitor use data has been very similar to the numbers collected in 2019, so it was determined with the guidance of the NPS statistics program to use the 2019 data to fill in for the missing data but ensuring that the total vehicle count collected in 2022, which was 500 vehicles higher than 2019, was incorporated into the final total vehicle counts.  Estimate of Other Backcountry Overnight Stays (from Park staff) are campers hiking the Harding Icefield trail and reporting camping in the trail register\n\n### OUTPUT:\nOctober: Herman Leier Road was closed on Oct 28, and the vehicle classifier was removed, resulting in no vehicle traffic data collection for the winter.\n### END"}
