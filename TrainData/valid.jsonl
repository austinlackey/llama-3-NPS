The car counter that is usually in the Overlook parking lot was moved to the Welcome Center parking lot, which offers less than half the number of spaces. Announcements were made advertising that the Overlook Park section of the park will be closed until construction is complete.

I divided that number by the 2.8 persons per car multiplier to get 160. I added the 160 to the main gate number from August last year, which gave the number of 5116 that I used for this report. This is not a perfect system, as many visitors use the park solely for recreation and the only way we get them counted is through the main gate number. Therefore, those users are unable to be counted for the 2nd half of August 2015.\n\n### OUTPUT:\nAugust: Main gate traffic counter has been out of service since August 14, leading to an estimate of 5116 visitors based on last year's data and VC numbers.\n### END"}

The Trailhead traffic counter was also replaced with a new one on September 12, but it quit working after one week. Again, I guesstimated numbers for each day based on visitor center visitation and weather. Since many Trailhead users are recreational, I also made sure to look at whether the day was weekend or week day.   Beginning on September 23 through the end of the month, we also had a lot of rain which affected visitation.   Not a perfect estimation, but it was as good as I could do given the circumstances.\n\n### OUTPUT:\nSeptember: No Closures.\n### END"}

Do not include closures that only happened for a few days or temporary closures due to weather or holidays. If you are unsure, default to no closures. The format should be as follows:\n<Month Name>: <1-2 concise sentence summary of closures>.\n\n### INPUT:\nComment for January:\nThe Netul Landing traffic counter was repaired on February 2 and was overcounting November - January so we've subtracted 100 from the count to have a more realistic number.   Gas prices are still stable and the weather on the coast has been fairly safe for driving.\n\n### OUTPUT:\nJanuary: No Closures.\n### END"}

The park has continued to be featured in much media because of the bicentennial, the fort fire, and the fort rebuild.\n\n### OUTPUT:\nDecember: No Closures.\n### END"}

Our park had a 98% solar eclipse on Aug. 21 and visitation was lower than normal that morning and we offered special programs for the visitors who were here and did we not turn on the theater programs until after the eclipse so no one would be watching a movie and realize later that they missed the eclipse!\n\n### OUTPUT:\nAugust: No Closures.\n### END"}

Most of them live within 50 miles of the park and heard the pass price is going up and decided that our park was the closest site for them to purchase this pass.  We've been encouraging them to take our Park Events page to plan future visits to our park. We're selling 10-20 Senior Passes per day lately.  Also, the Astoria area has just set a record (since data has been regularly collected) of 171 rainy days from the beginning of October through the end of April (7 months).  This has been a cool and wet fall/winter/spring.\n\n### OUTPUT:\nApril: No Closures.\n### END"}
