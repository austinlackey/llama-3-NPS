      "July, 2005 was an exceedingly hot month, with a few days that broke records.  High heat in the mid to upper 90s with 70 to 80% humidity resulting in a high heat index.  The excesive heat may have been responsible for lower vistation numbers at the Elizabeth Cady Stanton House, which is not air conditioned.  The staff at the information desk is careful to inform visitors of this fact on hot days, so that those who have trouble with the heat may make an informed decision on whether or not to take the tour.   4-Jul: Special Event-Reading of the Declaration of Sentiments- 9 10-Jul: AAVW- 13, chapel, film, exhibits, Stanton 11-Jul: Syracuse University- 52 15-Jul: Methodist Center- 20 17-Jul: Women's (Democratic Politicians) Event in Chapel 10:10-10:40 am (Samara Barend for Congress)- 10; Women's Rights Convention Dramatization- 150, 2pm; Fix Air Conditioning!!! 19-Jul: Camp Wanepee- 13 20-Jul: Fix Air Conditioning on 1st Floor!!
