CA190 east of Furnace Creek Inn and CA136 from CA190 on the park's west were closed the night of July 31 and into the day on August 1. Travel over Towne Pass was also restricted due to boulders and debris on the roadway.  On Friday, August 5 heavy down pour and significant flooding in the Furnace Creek area closed park operations. Other than IC, the VC and HQ offices remained closed. All park roads were deemed impassible by LE and the park housing community was advised to shelter in place.  The park re-opened to visitors on August 20!  Several entrances will remain closed for some time due to significant road damage: Daylight Pass, Ashford/CA 178, Titus Canyon, Lower Wildrose, CA190 westbound access from Lone Pine and via Towne Pass (Emigrant).

      "Comment for July:\n",
      "July, 2005 was an exceedingly hot month, with a few days that broke records.  High heat in the mid to upper 90s with 70 to 80% humidity resulting in a high heat index.  The excesive heat may have been responsible for lower vistation numbers at the Elizabeth Cady Stanton House, which is not air conditioned.  The staff at the information desk is careful to inform visitors of this fact on hot days, so that those who have trouble with the heat may make an informed decision on whether or not to take the tour.   4-Jul: Special Event-Reading of the Declaration of Sentiments- 9 10-Jul: AAVW- 13, chapel, film, exhibits, Stanton 11-Jul: Syracuse University- 52 15-Jul: Methodist Center- 20 17-Jul: Women's (Democratic Politicians) Event in Chapel 10:10-10:40 am (Samara Barend for Congress)- 10; Women's Rights Convention Dramatization- 150, 2pm; Fix Air Conditioning!!! 19-Jul: Camp Wanepee- 13 20-Jul: Fix Air Conditioning on 1st Floor!!

      "1.) BAIS Ranger left position at beginning of the month. 2.) MIIN has had broken HVAC/air conditioning since June. Idaho has seen record number of days at temps of high 90s-100s; prolonged heat wave has resulted in MIIN Visitor Center closing 3 to 4.5 hours early to mitigate heat exhaustion amongst staff and visitors. 3.) Yellowstone temporarily closed due to severe flooding and, even after reopening, has seen decreased visitation due to cancelled travel plans or potential visitors not knowing that the park is open. A significant portion of MIIN visitation comes from the traffic between YELL and the Pacific Northwest, so MIIN visitation may have similarly decreased. 4.) A large portion of MIIN visitors are semi/retired RV travelers; MIIN visitation may have decreased due to high cost of gas throughout the summer (national average $5.00+).  BAIS -- Estimated with a 10% decrease from July BAIS FY22 assumed from the lack of BAIS Ranger during the month of July. Bainbridge Island Japanese American Exclusion Memorial people counters have been broken since 03/2021. MIIN staff based out of Idaho and not able to easily make fixes to BAIS in WA state. The memorial is collectively cared for by the Bainbridge Island Japanese American Exclusion Memorial Association, the Bainbridge Island Japanese American Community, the Bainbridge Island Historical Museum, Bainbridge Island Parks & Recreation District and the Klondike Gold Rush National Historical Park - Seattle.\n"

      "Traffic counters at both Montezuma Castle and Montezuma Well are currently broken or malfunctioning.   At Montezuma Castle, visitation has been calculated using tallies from the fee collection cash registers. However, registers are counting pass users as single visits (one person), regardless of the number of individuals in the group. Additionally, several days of visitation data were not collected. In order to estimate this uncounted visitation, the data collector averaged the daily visitation for all other days (at 763 people per day) and inserted that number as the visitation for the missing dates (August 8, 22, 29, 30, 31).  To calculate the Daily Counter, Daily Cars were needed first and were calculated as (Daily Visitation - Daily Bus Passengers) / 2.8. Daily Counter numbers were then tabulated as each previous day's Counter (beginning with 0) + the previous day's cars + the previous day's buses + the previous day's staff crossings (6).  At Montezuma Well, the counter display is malfunctioning so that it's difficult to read. Based on the way the counter works, the visitation reported for Montezuma Well should be approximately correct.\n"
