      "January was very wintery in RMNP, with lots of snow, wind, and cold temperatures. Weather affects visitation. The Colorado Vehicle Traction Law became active several times, based on weather and road conditions.  The Fall River Entrance is undergoing major construction this winter. Although the entrance is open, visitors are being advised to enter the Beaver Meadows Entrance. Due to this major construction project, Fall River Entrance is an estimate based on 40% of the Beaver Meadows Entrance January count.  Grand Lake Entrance is a 5-year average due to damage from the 2020 East Troublesome Wildfire, and Wild Basin Entrance is a 5-year average due to a broken counter.\n",
      "\n",
      "February:\n",
      "March was very wintery, including cold, cloudy, gray days and it was very windy. It also snowed several days, which is typical. Snow drifted deeply in high mountain areas due to the high winds. Due to a construction project the Fall River Entrance is open but traffic is being directed to the Beaver Meadows Entrance. The Fall River Entrance (FRE) counter is not working. The FRE estimate is based on about 40% of the Beaver Meadows Entrance (BME) count, and was calculated based on past ratios of FRE to BME counts for February. Grand Lake Entrance (GLE), which counter was destroyed in a forest ire in 2020, has a similar calculation. The estimate for GLE is calculated based on 11% of the BME count and based on past ratios of GLE to BME counts for this time of year. This is the same method used to estimate the FRE numbers for November 2022 through January 2023. The Wild Basin Entrance (WBE) counter is broken, so the WBE is a 5-year average of previous Februarys.\n",

Fall River Entrance estimate is ~40% of the Beaver Meadows Entrance count based on past ratios of since the project started in November 2022.

This year, all trails were snowy and Trail Ridge Road & Old Fall River Road were closed to vehicles. Secondary roads didn't open until later in May. National Park Week included some special programs in RMNP and fee-free entrance on April 22. These are estimates for the Fall River Entrance (due to a major construction project), Grand Lake Entrance (counters were destroyed in a willdfire in 2020), and also for the Wild Basin Entrance (broken).

Trail Ridge Road opened for the season on Fri, May 26.  Aspenglen, Glacier Basin and Timber Creek Campgrounds opened for the season, Hiker Shuttle started, and visitor centers went to summer hours May 26-27.  Moraine Park Campground closed on May 25 until summer 2024 for a campground and utility rehabilitation project funded by the Great American Outdoors Act that will rehabilitate aging water, wastewater, and electrical distribution systems. Fall River Entrance traffic count is an estimate based off the Beaver Meadows Entrance traffic count. Grand Lake Entrance and Wild Basin Entrance traffic counts are five-year averages (2017, 2018, 2019, 2021, 2022)(2020 was excluded because RMNP was closed most of May for the covid pandemic.)\n",
